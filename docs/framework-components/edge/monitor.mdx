# Edge Monitor

The Edge Monitor monitors the status of the Edge Agents running on its
cluster. It raises alerts over Sparkplug if an Edge Agent does not
appear to be running correctly. It is also responsible for ensuring an
Edge Agent reloads its configuration when an updated version becomes
available from the Config Store.

## Overview

<EdgeCluster hilite="monitor"/>

The edge monitors are driven by Kubernetes resources deployed from the
Helm charts which deploy the Edge Agents. These SparkplugNode resources
identify an Edge Agent or other Sparkplug Node which should be monitored
by UUID. The monitor looks up the Sparkplug address of the Node in the
Config Store and observes its output. If a Node does not publish any packets
for several minutes, the monitor will send a rebirth request to check
the Node is still active. If a response is not received the monitor will
raise an alert over its own Sparkplug interface.

If the Node is expected to be an Edge Agent (as specified in the
SparkplugNode resource) the monitor will additionally verify that the
Edge Agent is running with the current version of its configuration. The
Edge Agent fetches its configuration from the Config Store at startup; along
with the configuration, the Config Store returns an HTTP Etag identifying
this particular revision of the config entry. The Edge Agent publishes
this information in its Node birth certificate.

The edge monitor watches for change-notify messages from the Config Store
and when an Edge Agent configuration entry changes so that the Edge
Agent is not using the most recent version, the monitor will send a CMD
to the Edge Agent instructing it to reload its configuration. If the
Edge Agent does not respond appropriately an alert is raised.

## MQTT interface

The Monitor publishes as a Sparkplug Node, and should be configured to
use the `Monitor` Node address under its cluster's Sparkplug Group. The
monitor creates a Device under this Node for each Node it is monitoring.
These Devices publish DBIRTH and DDEATH when the set of SparkplugNode
resources on the cluster changes; the monitor devices do not go offline
when the Nodes they are monitoring do.

The Node publishes using the _Monitor Node_ schema UUID. An edge monitor
publishes Link metrics linking the monitor Node to the UUID of the
cluster it is responsible for. The Devices also publish Links, to the
UUIDs of the devices they are monitoring. They also publish alert
metrics for the alerts they can raise.

## Well-known UUIDs

These well-known UUIDs are part of the core framework and all **MUST**
to be registered with the Configuration Store component under the
appropriate classes.
