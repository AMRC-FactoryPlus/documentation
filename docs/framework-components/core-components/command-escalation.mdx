# ⚠️ Command Escalation

## Well known UUIDs

<WellKnownUUID type='Application' name='Command Escalation'
               uuid='60e99f28-67fe-4344-a6ab-b1edb8b8e810'
               description='Commands permitted by a given permission.'/>

UUIDs created to grant Command Escalation permissions require a Config
Store entry of this type to define the meaning of the permission. All
such permissions need to be added to the 'Command Escalation
permissions' group defined below or the Command Escalation service will
not see the ACEs.

Entries **MUST** take the form of a JSON array of objects. Each entry in
the array specifies a particular Sparkplug metric which may be updated
by the client granted the permission. The object for each metric may
have the following properties:

| Property | Type |Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | Yes | The full metric name. |
| `type` | string | No | The Sparkplug type of the metric. |

The `type` is represented as one of the names used for metric types
in the Sparkplug specification. If the type is omitted, any type may be
sent.

<WellKnownUUID type='Application' name='Sparkplug Address Information'
               uuid='8e32801b-f35a-4cbf-a5c3-2af64d3debd7'
               description='The Sparkplug address used by an object.'/>

The 'target' of an ACE will be looked up in the Config Store under this
application. This means static entries will need to be created for
Sparkplug Devices intended as Command Escalation targets.

This application is documented more fully in the Config Store
documentation.

<WellKnownUUID type='Permission Group' name='Command Escalation permissions'
               uuid='9584ee09-a35a-4278-bc13-21a8be1f007c'
               description='Permissions recognised by the Command Escalation service.'/>

This well-known UUID represents the list of permissions the Command
Escalation service will request from the Auth service. It is important
that any permission UUIDs created to grant rights to request particular
commands are added to this group.

<WellKnownUUID type='Permission' name='Rebirth'
               uuid='fbb9c25d-386d-4966-a325-f16471d9f7be'
               description='Allow requesting a Sparkplug rebirth.'/>

This well-known permission grants access to request a rebirth from a
Sparkplug Node or Device. This needs to be created with a 'Command
Escalation' Config Store entry like this:

```json
[
    {
        "name": "Node Control/Rebirth",
        "type": "Boolean"
    },
    {
        "name": "Device Control/Rebirth",
        "type": "Boolean"
    }
]
```
