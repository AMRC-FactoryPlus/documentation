# Git server

The Git server provides a set of Git repositories hosted on the central
cluster of the Factory+ installation and integrated with the Factory+
framework. Creating and removing repositories is managed via the
Config Store, and authentication against the Git server is integrated with
the Factory+ identity and authorisation framework.

## Overview

<CentralCluster hilite="git"/>

The Git server registers itself with the Factory+ Directory at startup.
The service endpoints can be found via a Directory query for the Git
service function UUID.

Git repositories are managed through the Config Store, by creating entries
under the 'Git repository' application. If a repository is closely
associated with another object (for example, an edge cluster) the UUID
of that object can be used to identify the repo as well, otherwise a new
object should be created under the 'Git repository' Config Store class.

Creating an Application entry causes the repo to exist; removing it
again will remove all access to the repo. The history will not be lost,
and recreating the repo with the same UUID will cause the previous
history to reappear. It is possible to request that a particular repo
automatically synchronises a branch from an external repo; this can be
useful when the central cluster has external Internet access but the
edge clusters do not.

## HTTP interface

The Git server supports the standard Git protocol over HTTP, in addition
to certain Factory+-specific endpoints. Authentication follows the
normal Factory+ conventions: Basic or Negotiate will be accepted, or a
Bearer token retrieved from the `/token` endpoint. Credentials are
checked against the Factory+ Identity service and authorised via the
Authorisation service.

Git repos are accessible by two different URLs. Access by UUID, normally
used by machines, uses the URL path `/uuid/{UUID}`. Access by path,
intended for human users and not used by the Factory+ components
internally, uses the path `/git/{path}`, where `{path}` is the `path`
property from the Config Store entry governing this repository. These two
URLs will access the same repo, with the same history.

## MQTT Interface

The Git server provides push change-notify over Sparkplug. The Git
server does not use the Service Schema_UUID as service discovery over
MQTT is deprecated. Instead, the top-level Node uses the 'Git server'
schema, and the metric folders representing individual repos use 'Git
repository'.

The Git server provides the following metrics:

| Metric           | Type   | Description                                             |
|------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `Schema_UUID`    | UUID   | Identifies this as a Git server                         |
| `Instance_UUID`  | UUID   | The UUID of this server instance                        |
| `Repositories`   | Folder | Metrics for the repositories on this server             |

The `Repositories` folder contains another folder for each available
repo, named by the UUID of the repo. These folders have these metrics:

| Metric                | Type   | Description                                             |
|-----------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `Schema_UUID`         | UUID   | Identifies this as a Git repo                           |
| `Instance_UUID`       | UUID   | The UUID of this repository                             |
| `Branches`            | Folder | Metrics named for the branches on the repo              |
| `Branches/{branch}`   | String | SHA-1 of the commit at the head of the branch           |

The Git server will publish an NDATA packet every time a branch on a
repository moves, whether as a result of auto-pull or as a result of a
push from an authenticated client. The server will also rebirth every
time a repo is created or removed.

## Well-Known UUIDs

These well-known UUIDs are part of the core framework and all **MUST**
to be registered with the Configuration Store component under the
appropriate classes.

### Configuration and discovery

<WellKnownUUID type='Service Function' name='Git server'
               uuid='7adf4db0-2e7b-4a68-ab9d-376f4c5ce14b'

<WellKnownUUID type='Application' name='Git repository'
               uuid='38d62a93-b6b4-4f63-bad4-d433e3eaff29'
               description='Configuration for a Git repository'/>

<WellKnownUUID type='Class' name='Git repository'
               uuid='d25f2afc-1ab8-4d27-b51b-d02314624e3e'
               description='Stand-alone Git repository'/>

### Permissions

<Permission name={'Pull from repo'}

            uuid={'12ecb694-b4b9-4d2a-927e-d100019f7ebe'}></Permission>

<Permission name={'Push to repo'}
            description='Permission to push to a given Git repo'
            uuid={'b2d8d437-5060-4202-bcc2-bd2beda09651'}></Permission>

<Permission name={'Manage storage'}
            description='Permission to permanently delete Git repos including all history'
            uuid={'7fd8a8c1-6050-4950-97bd-a35bb83ff750'}></Permission>

<Permission type={'Permission Group'} name={'Git Permissions'}
            description={'Permissions recognised by the Git server'}
            uuid={'c0c55c78-116e-4526-8ff4-e4595251f76c'}></Permission>

This group must be created in the Authorisation Component containing the permission UUIDs listed above.

### Metric Schemas
