# MQTT

The MQTT component is the central communication hub through which all MQTT communications between components happen.

<OpenSourceExample buttonText={'ACS MQTT Component'} repoUrl={'https://github.com/AMRC-FactoryPlus/hivemq-krb'}></OpenSourceExample>

## Overview

<CentralCluster hilite="mqtt"/>

Similar to the [Data Warehouse Component](/docs/framework-components/central/data-warehouse), Factory+ does not prescribe a particular specification for the MQTT Component; it only necessitates that any chosen solution be MQTT 3.1 compatible. There are however a few requirements of any chosen MQTT broker that must be satisfied to ensure compatibility with Factory+.

### Authentication & Authorisation
Any chosen MQTT broker must be able to authenticate users via Kerberos and enforce fine-grained access control for topic management via rules from the [Authorisation Component](/docs/framework-components/central/authorisation).

:::info Using HiveMQ?
If you are using [HiveMQ](https://www.hivemq.com/), our [Factory+ plugin](https://github.com/AMRC-FactoryPlus/hivemq-krb) will handle this for you.

## Well-Known UUIDs

These well-known UUIDs are part of the core framework and all **MUST** to be registered with the [Configuration Store](/docs/framework-components/central/configuration-store) component under the appropriate classes.

### Identity

<WellKnownUUID type='Service Function' name='MQTT'
               uuid='feb27ba3-bd2c-4916-9269-79a61ebc4a47'
               description='MQTT Component service function'/>

---

<WellKnownUUID type='Service Account' name='MQTT'
               uuid='2f42daeb-4521-4522-8e19-85dfb73db88e'
               description='The client identity of the MQTT Component used to communicate with other services'/>

### Permission Groups

<WellKnownUUID type='Permission Group' name='MQTT permissions'
               uuid='a637134a-d06b-41e7-ad86-4bf62fde914a'
               description='All MQTT permissions need to be in this Group'/>

Any UUIDs created representing MQTT permissions **MUST** be added to this group in the Authorisation Component, otherwise the MQTT component will not be able to see the ACEs.

### Applications

<WellKnownUUID type='Application' name='MQTT Permission Template'
               uuid='1266ddf1-156c-4266-9808-d6949418b185'
               description='Expands a permission recognised by the MQTT plugin to an MQTT ACL'/>

UUIDs representing MQTT permissions need to have a Configuration Store entry of
this type. This entry serves as a template for the MQTT permissions
granted when the given permission UUID is granted in the Authorisation Component.

The entry **MUST** be a JSON object. Keys represent MQTT topics; values
represent the access granted to that topic. Values **MUST** be strings,
as defined below.

Topic names support the normal MQTT `+` and `#` wildcards. In addition,
if any of the percent sequences below appear in the topic name, the
`target` of the relevant ACE will be looked up under the 'Sparkplug
Address' application below. The percent sequence will be expanded to the
relevant property of the entry returned. If there is no such entry the
topic will be ignored (no permission will be granted).

| Sequence | Property   |
|----------|------------|
| `%g`     | `group_id` |
| `%n`     | `node_id`  |

The access granted is specified as a string containing one or more of
the characters below.

| Access | Meaning                                 |
|--------|-----------------------------------------|
| `r`    | Read data published to the given topic. |
| `w`    | Publish to the given topic.             |
| `s`    | Allow subscription to the given topic.  |

The `s` code is intended for implementations that distinguish between
'subscribe' and 'read' permissions. A client granted `s` permission
**SHOULD** be allowed to request subscription to the given topic, but
**MUST NOT** be sent packets for that topic unless `r` permission is
also granted.

Not all implementations will implement the `s` permission.
Implementations that do not **MAY** refuse subscription requests for
topics that do not have `r` permission. Currently the ACS HiveMQ plugin
does not implement `s`.
