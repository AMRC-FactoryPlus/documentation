The Configuration Store component serves as a framework-aware centralised repository for applications utilising Factory+ to store data, settings and other information associated with Factory+ entities. Storing data centrally facilitates the sharing of metadata among applications without duplicating definitions within applications and eliminates the need to incorporate the information in the birth certificate, which would result in size increments with each new metadata addition.

## Overview

<ComponentOverview></ComponentOverview>

Configuration Store component entries are saved as JSON documents.

Every category of configuration within the database is distinguished by an `Application_UUID`. While these UUIDs typically identify configuration specific to an individual application, they can also represent generic data utilised by multiple applications.

The fundamental design concept for the Configuration Store component stipulates that any entry saved under a specific `Application_UUID` **MUST** adhere to a schema, ensuring that consuming applications can effectively utilise it. Additionally, it is feasible to store these schemas themselves directly in the component, enabling validation and allowing a universal editing application to generate accurate configuration entries.

Within the Configuration Store component, an entry can be stored for any object identified by a UUID specific to a given application. The various object types represented by UUIDs can be configured by the administrator, initially including `Applications`, `Devices`, and `Schemas`.

- **Applications**, as defined above, can store global defaults using their respective `Application_UUID`.
- **Devices** correspond to Sparkplug Devices; refer to the [Directory component specification](/docs/framework-components/core-components/directory) for information on locating a device's `Instance_UUID`.
- **Schemas** pertain to Factory+ schemas as outlined in the [Schema specification](/docs/schemas) and are identified by the schema's `Schema_UUID`.

## Application Schema Requirements

* Application schemas **MUST** use the [2020-12](https://json-schema.org/specification-links.html#2020-12) draft version of JSON schema, i.e. the schema itself should have the `"$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema"` top-level property.
* Schemas **MUST** include an `$id` field with the value `urn:uuid:{Application_UUID}`, (e.g. `"$id": "urn:uuid:64a8bfa9-7772-45c4-9d1a-9e6290690957"`).
* Schemas should also include a `title` and `description` for the whole schema, and a `description` for every property, as this information may be used in future to build an editing interface for the config information.
* It is advisable to include `"additionalProperties": false` on object definitions otherwise the schema will allow random extra properties. This will make extending the schema in the future without invalidating existing data much harder.

## Well-Known UUIDs

Some UUIDs have been reserved that are required for core Factory+ functionality. These UUIDS **MUST** be present and correct in all Factory+ deployments.

### Class Definitions

Class definitions are the core building blocks of the Configuration
Store component. Every object known to the Store belongs to exactly one
class; there is no inheritance. The class indicates what kind of
real-world object the UUID represents; often this indicates to
applications and services consuming the UUID what operations can be
performed on that object.

Some classes of UUID are used internally by the Config Store. Some
others are also defined here as they are generally useful across all
services.

<WellKnownUUID type='Class Definition' name='Class Definition'
    uuid='04a1c90d-2295-4cbe-b33a-74eded62cbf1'
    description='Classes of UUID known to the Config Store.'/>

The class definition for the Class Definition class itself. All other
class definitions belong to this class.

<WellKnownUUID type='Class Definition' name='Wildcard'
    uuid='00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'
    description='The wildcard UUID.'/>

It is useful to be able to register configuration against this UUID,
even though it doesn't represent any real-world object. As such it is
defined as a class definition.

No objects should ever be created using this class.

<WellKnownUUID type='Class Definition' name='Application'
    uuid='d319bd87-f42b-4b66-be4f-f82ff48b93f0'
    description='Application UUIDs used by the Config Store.'/>

UUIDs registered with this class can be used in the `/app/{app}`
endpoints to store config information. A UUID of this class represents a
particular schema of config information.

<WellKnownUUID type='Class Definition' name='Service Function'
    uuid='265d481f-87a7-4f93-8fc6-53fa64dc11bb'
    description='Well-known UUIDs representing F+ service definitions.'/>

These UUIDs represent the Factory+ service specifications. Service
implementations publish these UUIDs to indicate that they conform to a
particular specification.

If we have two ACS installations running side-by-side, both with a
Config Store component, then those two Config Stores both advertise the
Config Store Service Function UUID. This indicates they both conform to
the Config Store specification.

<WellKnownUUID type='Class Definition' name='Metric Schema'
    uuid='83ee28d4-023e-4c2c-ab86-12c24e86372c'
    description='Factory+ Metric Schema.'/>

UUIDs of this class represent metric schemas defined under the Factory+
Data Schemas specification.

<WellKnownUUID type='Class Definition' name='Sparkplug Device'
    uuid='18773d6d-a70d-443a-b29a-3f1583195290'
    description='Compatibility class.'/>

Requests to the `/v1/app/{app}/device` compatibility endpoint are mapped
to this class. This should not be used any more; the objects formerly
represented as 'Sparkplug Devices' are now divided up into several
different classes.

### Applications

<WellKnownUUID type='Application' name='Object registration' 
    uuid='cb40bed5-49ad-4443-a7f5-08c75009da8f'
    description='Registration of a UUID within the Configuration Store.'/>

These entries are created by the `POST /v1/object` endpoint. They cannot
be created directly, as an entry for the object must exist before the
`/app/{app}/object` endpoint can be used.

Entries have a single property, `class`, indicating the class of the object.

<WellKnownUUID type='Application' name='General Object Information'
    uuid='64a8bfa9-7772-45c4-9d1a-9e6290690957'
    description='Information to help human users identify objects.'/>

These are intended for display to human users in user interfaces to help
the user understand what object is being referred to and should be brief
(no more than a few words).

Entries **MUST** have at least the following properties (this is likely to be extended in the future). 

| Property   | Type   | Required | Description                         |
|------------|--------|----------|-------------------------------------|
| `name`     | string | Yes      | A name for the object               |
| `location` | string | No       | The physical location of the object |
| `photo`    | string | No       | A base64-encoded photo              |
| `contact`  | array  | No       | An array of contact information     |

The `contact` property contains contact information for the people responsible for the object. The array contains objects with these properties:

| Property | Type   | Required | Description                      |
|----------|--------|----------|----------------------------------|
| `name`   | string | Yes      | The name of a responsible person |
| `email`  | string | Yes      | Their email address              |

<WellKnownUUID type='Application' name='Sparkplug Address Information'
    uuid='8e32801b-f35a-4cbf-a5c3-2af64d3debd7'
    description='The Sparkplug address used by an object.'/>

Where an object has a pre-defined Sparkplug address, entries with this
application can be used to allow this address to be looked up. Under the
current architecture Sparkplug Nodes have fixed addresses and require
entries of this type. Sparkplug Devices are discovered via the Directory
and do not need these entries.

Entries of this type are used by the MQTT service to define ACLs, and by
the Command Escalation service to authenticate escalation requests over
MQTT.

Entries have the following properties:

|Property   |Type   |Required   |Description                |
|---|---|---|---|
|`group_id` |string |Yes        |The Sparkplug Group-ID     |
|`node_id`  |string |Yes        |The Sparkplug Node-ID      |
|`device_id`|string |No         |The Sparkplug Device-ID    |

## Discovery

As per the [Component
Specification](/docs/framework-components/specification), the
Configuration Store component provides a MQTT/Sparkplug interface and a
HTTP interface.

<WellKnownUUID type='Service Function' name='Config Store'
    uuid='af15f175-78a0-4e05-97c0-2a0bb82b9f3b'
    description='Config Store service specification.'/>

## MQTT/Sparkplug Interface

To conform with the [Component Specification](/docs/framework-components/specification), the Directory component **MUST** publish the following metrics:

| Metric      | Type | A config entry has changed for: |
|-------------|------|---------------------------------|
| Application | UUID | An application                  |
| Device      | UUID | An device                       |
| Schema      | UUID | A schema                        |

The `Application` metric will have `A` published to it for updates to both `/v1/app/A/...` and `/v1/app/.../app/A`, i.e. both updates to this app's configuration and updates to configuration about this app.

:::caution
Note that while it is currently the case that an update to `/v1/app/A/device/D` will publish `A` to `Application` and `D` to `Device` in the same Sparkplug packet, this is explicitly not guaranteed. Sparkplug does not allow assumptions to be made about any relationship between metric values published in the same packet.
:::

## HTTP Interface

Except for the `/ping` endpoint, all endpoints for the Configuration Store component are located under the `/v1` path to allow for forwards compatibility.

### Authentication

All requests **MUST** supply HTTP authentication; the following mechanisms are supported:

| Mechanism | Authentication info required                                   |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Negotiate | A Kerberos GSSAPI token.                                       |
| Basic     | Username and password for a password-based Kerberos principal. |
| Bearer    | A token from the `/token` endpoint.                            |

## Examples

### Global Application Configuration

The global application configuration can be managed via the `/v1/app/{Application_UUID}/config` endpoint. For compatibility reasons. This accepts `GET`, `PUT` and `DELETE` requests and is exactly equivalent to `/v1/app/{Application_UUID}/app/{Application_UUID}`.

### Managing Applications

Before configuration can be stored for a particular application, the `Application_UUID` **MUST** be registered with the service. The following endpoints are available for this purpose.

#### Get All Applications
```javascript
// Returns an array listing all the known app UUIDs.

GET /v1/app
```

#### Registering and Updating Applications
```javascript
// Registers a new application or updates an existing registration.

POST /v1/app
```

When making a `POST` request to register a new application the body should be an object with the following properties:

| Property | Description                                |
|----------|--------------------------------------------|
| `uuid`   | The `Application_UUID`.                    |
| `name`   | A human-readable name for the application. |

#### Get Application Information

```javascript
// Retrieves information about a particular application.
// e.g. GET /v1/app/123-456

GET /v1/app/{Application_UUID}
```

#### Delete Applications
There is currently no endpoint to delete applications. This is potentially a very destructive operation as it would need to delete all configuration entries stored against that `Application_UUID.`

### Application Configuration Schemas

#### Getting Schemas
The schema used by an application to store its configuration entries can be accessed my making a request to the following endpoint. This request will return `404` if no configuration schema has been registered for a particular application.

```javascript
// Get the schema for an application's configuration
// e.g. GET /v1/app/123-456/config-schema

GET /v1/app/{Application_UUID}/config-schema
```

#### Creating Schemas

This request will only accept a new schema if all configuration entries currently in the database for that application validate against the new schema. If this validation step fails the endpoint will return a status code of `409 Conflict`, with a JSON array body listing all the `Instance_UUIDs` for which validation failed. This will include the `Application_UUID` itself if validation failed for the application's global configuration.

```javascript
// Create a new schema for an application's configuration
// e.g. PUT /v1/app/123-456/config-schema

PUT /v1/app/{Application_UUID}/config-schema
```

### Per-Object Configuration

The following endpoints for per-object configuration contain a component identifying the kind of object being referred to. This component should be

| Object kind | Component |
|-------------|-----------|
| Application | `app`     |
| Device      | `device`  |
| Schema      | `schema`  |


#### Getting Configuration for All Objects

```javascript
// Get a list of all the objects which have configuration entries for a particular application
// e.g. GET /v1/app/123-456/device

GET /v1/app/{Application_UUID}/{object_type}
```

A request to the above endpoint would return an array of object UUIDs.

#### Managing Configuration for a Specific Object

```javascript
// Get the configuration for the specified object
// e.g. GET /v1/app/123-456/device/abc-def

GET /v1/app/{Application_UUID}/{object_type}/{object_uuid}
```
```javascript
// Create a new configuration for the specified object
// e.g. PUT /v1/app/123-456/device/abc-def

PUT /v1/app/{Application_UUID}/{object_type}/{object_uuid}
```
```javascript
// Delete the configuration for the specified object
// e.g. DELETE /v1/app/123-456/device/abc-def

DELETE /v1/app/{Application_UUID}/{object_type}/{object_uuid}
```

If a schema is registered for the application and an entry supplied does not validate then a `403` status code is returned.
