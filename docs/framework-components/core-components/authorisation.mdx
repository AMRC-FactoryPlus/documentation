The Authorisation component is an essential part Factory+, as it ensures that access to resources is controlled and restricted based on the permissions assigned to various principals or actors in the system. Access Control Lists (ACLs) are used to manage these permissions and provide a flexible way to define and manage access control policies.

## Overview

<ComponentOverview></ComponentOverview>

The Factory+ Authorisation component can be broken down into the following elements:

- **Principals**: Principals are the entities (users, services, or applications) that interact with the architecture and request access to its resources. Each principal is identified using a unique ID, referred to as a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) that conforms to RFC4122. The [Identity](/docs/framework-components/core-components/identity) component is responsible for managing the principals.
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: ACLs are data structures that specify the access permissions for resources in the system. Each entry in an ACL defines a particular action that a principal is allowed or denied to perform on a specific resource. ACLs use UUIDs to reference both the principals and the resources.
- **Resource Management**: The resources in the system are managed by different components, and each component is responsible for defining its own ACLs. This allows for a decentralised approach to access control, where each component can define its own rules based on its unique requirements.
- **Access Control Enforcement**: When a principal attempts to access a resource, the Authorisation component checks the corresponding ACLs to determine if the action is allowed. If the principal's UUID is found in the ACL with the appropriate permissions, access is granted; otherwise, access is denied.


### Linking Identity
The Authorisation component in Factory+ plays a crucial role in managing the relationship between internal Principal UUIDs and [identities](/docs/framework-components/core-components/identity). The Authorisation component maintains a mapping table that links each Principal UUID to its corresponding Kerberos principal, ensuring that access control requests from authenticated entities can be resolved. With the Principal UUID and the associated ACL information, the Authorisation component can evaluate the user's permissions on the requested resources, ensuring that only authorised actions are allowed.

### Access Control Entries (ACEs)

An Access Control Entry (ACE) is a fundamental building block of the Factory+ Authorisation component. It defines the relationship
between three key elements: a principal, a permission, and a target:

- **Principal (UUID)**: The principal is an entity (user, service, or application) that requests access to a resource. It is represented by a UUID, which uniquely identifies the principal within the system.
- **Permission (UUID)**: The permission specifies the type of action that the principal is allowed to perform on the target resource. It is also represented by a UUID, which helps to maintain a consistent and standardised set of permissions across the system.
- **Target (UUID)**: The target is the resource that the principal is trying to access. It is represented by a UUID to ensure that each resource in the system can be uniquely identified and referenced.

The semantics of an ACE can be summarised as: "This principal (UUID) has this permission (UUID) on this target (UUID)." The access control system checks the ACEs in the Access Control List (ACL) to determine if a principal is authorised to perform a particular action on a target resource. If a matching ACE is found in the ACL, the principal is granted access; otherwise, access is denied.

#### Deny-by-default
In Factory+, the access control system uses allow-only ACEs and follows a deny-by-default permission model. This approach ensures that access to resources is denied unless explicitly granted by an ACE, providing a higher level of security.

The Permission and Target UUIDs in the ACEs are interpreted and enforced by the individual services that make use of the access control system. Each service defines the semantics of these UUIDs based on its own requirements and resource management policies.

#### Wildcard UUID

The null UUID (`00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`) is conventionally used as a wildcard target, with two possible interpretations:

1. **This permission on all targets**: When the null UUID is used as the target in an ACE, it signifies that the specified permission applies to all resources managed by the service. This allows the principal to perform the specified action on any target within the service's domain.
2. **This permission needs no target**: In some cases, a permission may not require a specific target to be associated with it. When the null UUID is used as the target, it signifies that the permission itself is sufficient to grant the principal access to the service, without needing to specify any particular resource.

#### Permission Groups

In Factory+, the use of groups in access control management is a practical way to reduce duplication and simplify the maintenance of ACLs. Groups can be utilised for any of the three UUIDs (Principal, Permission, or Target), allowing for more efficient access control policies. The Authorisation component is responsible for managing groups, as they must be defined and available before other services can be successfully contacted.

Groups can contain other groups, allowing for a hierarchical structure that simplifies access control management. Nested groups are expanded recursively, meaning that all members of a group (including those in nested groups) are considered when evaluating access control policies.

## Discovery

As per the [Component Specification](/docs/framework-components/specification), the Authorisation component provides a HTTP interface. It does not provide a Sparkplug Interface. The Authorisation component uses `cab2642a-f7d9-42e5-8845-8f35affe1fd4` as the `Service_UUID`.

## HTTP Interface

### Authentication

All requests must supply HTTP authentication; the following mechanisms are supported:

| Mechanism | Authentication info required                                   |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Negotiate | A Kerberos GSSAPI token.                                       |
| Basic     | Username and password for a password-based Kerberos principal. |
| Bearer    | A token from the `/token` endpoint.                            |
