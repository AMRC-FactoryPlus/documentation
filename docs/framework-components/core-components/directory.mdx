The Directory component is designed to help applications, users, and other components find the devices and services they require. By monitoring Sparkplug birth and death messages, it keeps a comprehensive registry of devices and services, including their current status, schemas, and endpoints, making it easier for consuming applications to locate them. Instructions on how consuming applications should locate and connect to the Directory is outlined in the [examples](#examples) section.

## Overview

<ComponentOverview></ComponentOverview>

As described in the Factory+ Schemas specification, every device participating in the Factory+ architecture, [including those nested within a physical device]((/docs/schemas#reusability)), is assigned a persistent `Instance_UUID` for identification purposes. This UUID is positioned alongside the `Schema_UUID` at all birth certificate levels, allowing devices to establish their identity and the schemas that they are conforming to. The Directory component monitors the namespace for birth certificates issued by devices and uses this information to track schema usage and the current Sparkplug topic (group, node, device) on which devices are publishing, allowing clients to locate specific devices or devices conforming to specific schemas. By maintaining the link between `Instance_UUIDs` and Sparkplug topics, devices can be physically moved, altering their Sparkplug address, whilst preserving their identity throughout the architecture.

Devices lacking an `Instance_UUID` in their birth certificate will be unable to publish their own UUID. In such cases, the Directory will allocate a UUID to the device and associate it with the Sparkplug address. Subsequent usage of the same Sparkplug address will result in the assignment of the same UUID. However, providing a Factory+ compliant birth certificate with an `Instance_UUID` will override this behaviour.

## Discovery

As per the [Component Specification](/docs/framework-components/specification), the Directory component provides a MQTT Interface and a HTTP interface.

<WellKnownUUID type='Service Function' name='Directory'
               uuid='af4a1d66-e6f7-43c4-8a67-0fa3be2b1cf9'
               description='Directory Component service function'/>

## MQTT Interface

The Directory component Sparkplug interface **MUST** use the well-known address `[ORGANISATION]-Service-DIR-Directory/Directory`, where `[ORGANISATION]-Service-DIR-Directory/Directory` is the group name and `Directory` is the node name. This allows the Directory to be located over MQTT without using the HTTP API.

To conform with the [Component Specification](/docs/framework-components/specification), the Directory component **MUST** publish the following metrics:

| Metric           | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## HTTP Interface

Except for the `/ping` endpoint, all endpoints for the Directory component are located under the `/v1` path to allow for forwards compatibility. All endpoints are `GET`-only and all responses are JSON.

### Authentication

All requests must supply HTTP authentication; the following mechanisms are supported:

| Mechanism | Authentication info required                                   |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Negotiate | A Kerberos GSSAPI token.                                       |
| Basic     | Username and password for a password-based Kerberos principal. |
| Bearer    | A token from the `/token` endpoint.                            |

### Specification

<OpenAPISpecRenderer url={useBaseUrl('/spec/directory.yaml')} text={'the Directory component'}/>


## Well-Known UUIDs

These well-known UUIDs are part of the core framework and all **MUST** to be registered with the Configuration Store component under the appropriate classes.

### Identity

<WellKnownUUID type='Service Function' name='Directory'
               uuid='af4a1d66-e6f7-43c4-8a67-0fa3be2b1cf9'
               description='The server identity of the Directory Component that provides the service'/>

---

<WellKnownUUID type='Service Account' name='Directory'
               uuid='5cc3b068-938f-4bb2-8ceb-64338a02fbeb'
               description='The client identity of Directory Component used to communicate with other services'/>

---

### Permission Groups

<Permission type={'Permission Group'} name={'Directory Permissions'}
            description={'Permissions recognised by the Directory'}
            uuid={'58b5da47-d098-44f7-8c1d-6e4bd800e718'}></Permission>

This group must be created in the Authorisation Component containing the permission UUIDs listed below.

---

### Permissions

<Permission name={'Advertise Service'}
            description='Permission to advertise a given service'
            uuid={'4db4c39a-f18d-4e83-aeb0-5af2c14ddc2b'}></Permission>

This grants permission for a given account to advertise the given service.

<Permission name={'Manage Service Advertisement for Owner'}
            description="Permission to advertise a service on another account's behalf"
            uuid={'97dcf2a1-7f4b-476c-b561-e40fc42440ee'}></Permission>

This grants the `principal` account (normally an administrator account, or an operator account performing this specific function) permission to advertise services for the `target`, which also represents an account. This allows use of the `/v1/service/{service}/advertisment/{owner}` endpoint.

In addition to the `principal` account having this permission on the target account, either
- The `target` account must have `Advertise Service`, or
- The `principal` account must have `Override Service Advertisment Permissions`

on the service function UUID being advertised.

---

<Permission name={'Override Service Advertisement Permissions'}
            description='Permission to override advertisment permissions for this service'
            uuid={'3bda2ab2-4128-463d-83c9-16b976a8d83e'}></Permission>

This grants an account permission to advertise services on behalf of another account that the other account cannot advertise on its own behalf. The `target` of the permission is the service function UUID being advertised.

### Metric Schemas

<WellKnownUUID type='Metric Schema' name='Service V1'
               uuid='05688a03-730e-4cda-9932-172e2c62e45c'
               description='Schema recognised by the Directory as containing a service advertisment'/>

If a Sparkplug device includes this schema in its Birth Certificate, the Directory will recognise it as a service advertisement and publish the supplied URL over HTTP.

---

## Examples
### Listing All Devices

A list of all known devices can be obtained by making a `GET` request to `/v1/device`, which returns an array of device UUIDs.

### Finding a Device via its Instance_UUID

If the `Instance_UUID` of a device is known then it can be queried with a `/v1/device/{Instance_UUID}` request to the Directory. This returns a JSON
object with the following properties:

| Property      | Description                                             |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `uuid`        | The device's top-level `Instance_UUID`                  |
| `group_id`    | The Sparkplug Group ID this device last used            |
| `node_id`     | The Sparkplug Edge Node ID this device last used        |
| `device_id`   | The Sparkplug Device ID this device last used           |
| `online`      | A boolean indicating if this device is currently online |
| `last_change` | The time this device last went on or offline            |
| `schemas`     | An array of the schemas supported by this device        |
| `top_schema`  | The top-level schema this device advertises             |

If the `device_id` property is missing or is an empty string then the device is a Sparkplug Node device that uses `NBIRTH`, `NDATA`, `NDEATH` topics. Otherwise it is a Sparkplug Device and uses `DBIRTH`, `DDATA`, `DDEATH` topics. A particular device may change from being to a Node to a Device or vice versa, depending on operational changes.

The schemas reported are those present in the device's most recent birth certificate. If the device does not publish a `Schema_UUID` at the top of its metric tree, then `top_schema` will be reported as `null`.

### Finding a Device via its Sparkplug Address

If the Sparkplug address of a device is known (`group_id`, `node_id`, `device_id`) then it can be queried with request to the Directory as outlined below.

```
GET /v1/address/{group_id}/{node_id}
GET /v1/address/{group_id}/{node_id}/{device_id}
```

This returns a JSON object with the following properties:

| Property   | Description                                            |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `address`  | The address queries, as a single string                |
| `uuid`     | The UUID of the most recent device to use this address |
| `children` | An array of the Devices seen under this node           |

The `children` array is only present for a request containing no devices (`/v1/address/{group_id}/{node_id}`) and contains the `device_id` for every device ever seen under that Node.

### Finding Devices that use a Schema

A `GET` request can be made to the `/v1/schema` endpoint that returns a JSON array listing all the `Schema_UUID`s the Directory has ever seen.

Given a particular `Schema_UUID`, a `GET` request to `/v1/schema/{Schema_UUID}/devices` returns a JSON array listing the `Device_UUID`s of all devices that reported that schema in their most recent birth certificate.

### Discovering Services

A `GET` request to `/v1/service` returns a JSON array listing all `Service_UUID`s that Directory knows about.

Once a `Service_UUID` is obtained, a `GET` request to `/v1/service/{Service_UUID}` returns a JSON array of objects, one for each device providing the given service. Each object has the following properties:

| Property  | Description                                           |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `service` | The service UUID queried                              |
| `device`  | The device UUID of a device providing this service    |
| `url`     | A URL on which the device provides additional service |

## Known Issues
- In the absence of a reliability mechanism (specifically, no STATE support), the directory service's view of the network begins to deviate from the actual state when it becomes unavailable. This can lead to significant repercussions, particularly in the case of missed death certificates which cannot be identified and will only be rectified upon the eventual reconnection of the affected device.
- If bad data is received via Sparkplug it will be recorded and returned. In the event of two devices simultaneously publishing on the same Sparkplug address, the data returned from the directory will be highly ambiguous.
