Factory+ was ultimately developed to be a vehicle to help solve manufacturing problems. A project that started out as a small piece of research into current best practices for digital factory architectures quickly evolved into a robust framework that is now adopted as an operational standard across the [AMRC](https://www.amrc.co.uk/), the UK's largest High Value Manufacturing Catapult Centre, and beyond. Because Factory+ defines a scalable, robust approach to architecture, data models, transport protocols, storage strategies, contextualisation and consumption of manufacturing data, we as a research organisation can focus on the things that matter - using the data that we're collecting to impart meaningful changes in the manufacturing sector.

Factory+ has been extremely well received both inside and outside the AMRC and the number of areas where it can be applied to impart real, meaningful change is beyond anything that we could have possibly imagined. The requirements of those using the architecture drove us to do more, make it better and ensure that it can continue to deliver value both as a research platform and as an operational solution for years to come.
