# Identity

Factory+ utilises [Kerberos](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/) as its identity provider to enhance the security and authentication processes within the architecture. By utilising Kerberos, Factory+ ensures that users and services can authenticate themselves in a secure and reliable manner, while also allowing for seamless integration with external systems that rely on the same authentication mechanism and/or other Factory+ deployments.

## Overview

<CentralCluster hilite="identity"/>

Kerberos is a network authentication protocol designed to provide strong, secure authentication for client-server applications. It was developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the 1980s and has become a widely adopted standard for secure authentication in various systems, including Windows domains and Unix environments.

The key features of Kerberos include:

- **Mutual Authentication**: Kerberos ensures that both the client and server can verify each other's identity, preventing potential attacks like eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle, and impersonation.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Once a user has authenticated with Kerberos, they can access multiple services and applications within the network without having to re-authenticate, simplifying the user experience and reducing the need for multiple sets of credentials.
- **Symmetric Key Cryptography**: Kerberos uses symmetric key cryptography for encrypting and decrypting messages between clients and servers, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of data.
- **Ticket-Based Authentication**: The core concept of Kerberos is the use of "tickets" to grant access to services. When a user authenticates with the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC), they receive a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT), which can then be used to request service-specific tickets without requiring further authentication.
- **Scalability**: Kerberos is designed to support large-scale networks with numerous clients and services, making it suitable for
various organisational sizes and structures.
