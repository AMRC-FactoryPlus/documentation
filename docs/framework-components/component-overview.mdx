# Component Overview

import { CentralCluster, EdgeCluster } from "../../src/components/Clusters";

Factory+ identifies a set of interconnected core components that must be
present for a full implementation of the framework. See
[Overview](../overview) for the motivation behind these components and
how they fit into the larger picture of a modern IIoT architecture.

Since version 2, the ACS implementation of Factory+ has relied heavily
on Kubernetes to manage the deployment of components. Version 3 of ACS
takes a further step, requiring that Edge Agents on the shop floor run
on separate Kubernetes clusters from the central services.

## Central components

These are the components running on the central cluster. This cluster
provides the central MQTT broker, long-term data storage and control of
the edge clusters.

| Central Monitor     | Monitoring the Edge Monitors to ensure clusters do not go offline                                  |
| MQTT                | Handling communication and data exchange between devices, applications, and services               |

## Edge components

These are the components running at the edge. Moving the components out
to their own Kubernetes cluster isolates the central services from any
security problems caused by devices needing to be physically present on
the shop floor. This also means that different Kubernetes
implementations can be used for the different clusters, for example the
central cluster could use a cloud cluster provider and the edge clusters
an edge-focussed Kubernetes distribution.

| Edge Sync           | Updating the central services on the state of the edge cluster                                     |

## Plugin Components

Factory+ not only identifies the core components that are required for a complete deployment of the framework, but it also defines a component specification that allows for the development of Plugin Components that can fully integrate with the framework. These plugins can be developed by anyone and can interact with the framework in various ways. Some plugins may offer data access, while others may enhance the functionality of the core Factory+ framework, such as the official [Files Plugin Component](https://github.com/AMRC-FactoryPlus/acs-files) developed by AMRC.
