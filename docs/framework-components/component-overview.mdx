Factory+ identifies a set of interconnected core components that must be present for a full implementation of the framework. See [Overview](../overview) for the motivation behind these components and how they fit into the larger picture of a modern IIoT architecture.

<ComponentOverview/>

| Function            | Description                                                                                        |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Identity            | Ensuring unique identification of devices, users, and applications across the architecture         |
| Authorisation       | Managing access control and permissions for devices, users, and applications across all components |
| Directory           | Maintaining a registry of services and devices, complete with their status, schemas and endpoints  |
| MQTT                | Handling communication and data exchange between devices, applications, and services               |
| Edge Agent          | Managing edge data capture, schema mapping, encoding, and transmission                             |
| Configuration Store | Storing and managing shared metadata data for devices, applications, and services                  |
| Manager             | Centralise device onboarding, configuration and management                                         |
| Commands            | Handling the escalation of commands and alerts across the architecture                             |
| Data Warehouse      | Ingesting, decoding, storing and  managing collected data from devices and applications            |

## Plugin Components

Factory+ not only identifies the core components that are required for a complete deployment of the framework, but it also defines a component specification that allows for the development of Plugin Components that can fully integrate with the framework. These plugins can be developed by anyone and can interact with the framework in various ways. Some plugins may offer data access, while others may enhance the functionality of the core Factory+ framework, such as the official [Files Plugin Component](https://github.com/AMRC-FactoryPlus/acs-files) developed by AMRC.
