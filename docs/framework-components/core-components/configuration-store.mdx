The Configuration Store component serves as a framework-aware centralised repository for applications utilising Factory+ to store data, settings and other information associated with Factory+ entities. Storing data centrally facilitates the sharing of metadata among applications without duplicating definitions within applications and eliminates the need to incorporate the information in the birth certificate, which would result in size increments with each new metadata addition.

## Overview

<ComponentOverview></ComponentOverview>

Configuration Store component entries are saved as JSON documents.

Every category of configuration within the database is distinguished by an `Application_UUID`. While these UUIDs typically identify configuration specific to an individual application, they can also represent generic data utilised by multiple applications.

The fundamental design concept for the Configuration Store component stipulates that any entry saved under a specific `Application_UUID` **MUST** adhere to a schema, ensuring that consuming applications can effectively utilise it. Additionally, it is feasible to store these schemas themselves directly in the component, enabling validation and allowing a universal editing application to generate accurate configuration entries.

Within the Configuration Store component, an entry can be stored for any object identified by a UUID specific to a given application. The various object types represented by UUIDs can be configured by the administrator, initially including `Applications`, `Devices`, and `Schemas`.

- **Applications**, as defined above, can store global defaults using their respective `Application_UUID`.
- **Devices** correspond to Sparkplug Devices; refer to the [Directory component specification](/docs/framework-components/core-components/directory) for information on locating a device's `Instance_UUID`.
- **Schemas** pertain to Factory+ schemas as outlined in the [Schema specification](/docs/schemas) and are identified by the schema's `Schema_UUID`.

## Application Schema Requirements

* Application schemas **MUST** use the [2020-12](https://json-schema.org/specification-links.html#2020-12) draft version of JSON schema, i.e. the schema itself should have the `"$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema"` top-level property.
* Schemas **MUST** include an `$id` field with the value `urn:uuid:{Application_UUID}`, (e.g. `"$id": "urn:uuid:64a8bfa9-7772-45c4-9d1a-9e6290690957"`).
* Schemas should also include a `title` and `description` for the whole schema, and a `description` for every property, as this information may be used in future to build an editing interface for the config information.
* It is advisable to include `"additionalProperties": false` on object definitions otherwise the schema will allow random extra properties. This will make extending the schema in the future without invalidating existing data much harder.

## Well-Known UUIDs

Some UUIDs have been reserved for applications that are likely to be useful across many applications and instances of Factory+.
- [ ] Continue to outline the hard-coded required UUIDs from the dumps here and define that they **MUST** be seeded as such.

### General Device Information

This application has an `Application_UUID` of `64a8bfa9-7772-45c4-9d1a-9e6290690957`.

Entries **MUST** have at least the following properties (this is likely to be extended in the future). These are intended for display to human users in user interfaces to help the user understand what object is being referred to and should be brief (no more than a few words).

| Property   | Type   | Required | Description                          |
|------------|--------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| `name`     | string | Yes      | A name for the object.               |
| `location` | string | No       | The physical location of the object. |
| `photo`    | string | No       | A base64-encoded photo.              |
| `contact`  | array  | No       | An array of contact information.     |

The `contact` property contains contact information for the people responsible for the object. The array contains objects with these properties:

| Property | Type   | Required | Description                       |
|----------|--------|----------|-----------------------------------|
| `name`   | string | Yes      | The name of a responsible person. |
| `email`  | string | Yes      | Their email address.              |

## Discovery

As per the [Component Specification](/docs/framework-components/specification), the Configuration Store component provides a MQTT/Sparkplug interface and a HTTP interface. The Configuration Store component uses `af15f175-78a0-4e05-97c0-2a0bb82b9f3b` as the `Service_UUID`.

## MQTT/Sparkplug Interface

To conform with the [Component Specification](/docs/framework-components/specification), the Directory component **MUST** publish the following metrics:

| Metric      | Type | A config entry has changed for: |
|-------------|------|---------------------------------|
| Application | UUID | An application                  |
| Device      | UUID | An device                       |
| Schema      | UUID | A schema                        |

The `Application` metric will have `A` published to it for updates to both `/v1/app/A/...` and `/v1/app/.../app/A`, i.e. both updates to this app's configuration and updates to configuration about this app.

:::caution
Note that while it is currently the case that an update to `/v1/app/A/device/D` will publish `A` to `Application` and `D` to `Device` in the same Sparkplug packet, this is explicitly not guaranteed. Sparkplug does not allow assumptions to be made about any relationship between metric values published in the same packet.
:::

## HTTP Interface

Except for the `/ping` endpoint, all endpoints for the Configuration Store component are located under the `/v1` path to allow for forwards compatibility.

### Authentication

All requests **MUST** supply HTTP authentication; the following mechanisms are supported:

| Mechanism | Authentication info required                                   |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Negotiate | A Kerberos GSSAPI token.                                       |
| Basic     | Username and password for a password-based Kerberos principal. |
| Bearer    | A token from the `/token` endpoint.                            |

### Specification

<OpenAPISpecRenderer url={useBaseUrl('/spec/configuration-store.yaml')} text={'the Configuration Store component'} />


## Examples

### Global Application Configuration

The global application configuration can be managed via the `/v1/app/{Application_UUID}/config` endpoint. For compatibility reasons. This accepts `GET`, `PUT` and `DELETE` requests and is exactly equivalent to `/v1/app/{Application_UUID}/app/{Application_UUID}`.

### Managing Applications

Before configuration can be stored for a particular application, the `Application_UUID` **MUST** be registered with the service. The following endpoints are available for this purpose.

#### Get All Applications
```javascript
// Returns an array listing all the known app UUIDs.

GET /v1/app
```

#### Registering and Updating Applications
```javascript
// Registers a new application or updates an existing registration.

POST /v1/app
```

When making a `POST` request to register a new application the body should be an object with the following properties:

| Property | Description                                |
|----------|--------------------------------------------|
| `uuid`   | The `Application_UUID`.                    |
| `name`   | A human-readable name for the application. |

#### Get Application Information

```javascript
// Retrieves information about a particular application.
// e.g. GET /v1/app/123-456

GET /v1/app/{Application_UUID}
```

#### Delete Applications
There is currently no endpoint to delete applications. This is potentially a very destructive operation as it would need to delete all configuration entries stored against that `Application_UUID.`

### Application Configuration Schemas

#### Getting Schemas
The schema used by an application to store its configuration entries can be accessed my making a request to the following endpoint. This request will return `404` if no configuration schema has been registered for a particular application.

```javascript
// Get the schema for an application's configuration
// e.g. GET /v1/app/123-456/config-schema

GET /v1/app/{Application_UUID}/config-schema
```

#### Creating Schemas

This request will only accept a new schema if all configuration entries currently in the database for that application validate against the new schema. If this validation step fails the endpoint will return a status code of `409 Conflict`, with a JSON array body listing all the `Instance_UUIDs` for which validation failed. This will include the `Application_UUID` itself if validation failed for the application's global configuration.

```javascript
// Create a new schema for an application's configuration
// e.g. PUT /v1/app/123-456/config-schema

PUT /v1/app/{Application_UUID}/config-schema
```

### Per-Object Configuration

The following endpoints for per-object configuration contain a component identifying the kind of object being referred to. This component should be

| Object kind | Component |
|-------------|-----------|
| Application | `app`     |
| Device      | `device`  |
| Schema      | `schema`  |


#### Getting Configuration for All Objects

```javascript
// Get a list of all the objects which have configuration entries for a particular application
// e.g. GET /v1/app/123-456/device

GET /v1/app/{Application_UUID}/{object_type}
```

A request to the above endpoint would return an array of object UUIDs.

#### Managing Configuration for a Specific Object

```javascript
// Get the configuration for the specified object
// e.g. GET /v1/app/123-456/device/abc-def

GET /v1/app/{Application_UUID}/{object_type}/{object_uuid}
```
```javascript
// Create a new configuration for the specified object
// e.g. PUT /v1/app/123-456/device/abc-def

PUT /v1/app/{Application_UUID}/{object_type}/{object_uuid}
```
```javascript
// Delete the configuration for the specified object
// e.g. DELETE /v1/app/123-456/device/abc-def

DELETE /v1/app/{Application_UUID}/{object_type}/{object_uuid}
```

If a schema is registered for the application and an entry supplied does not validate then a `403` status code is returned.
