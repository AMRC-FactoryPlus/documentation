# Manager

The primary function of the Factory+ Manager component is to offer an interface for configuring, storing, and delivering edge agent configurations to the respective edge agents. Despite its straightforward API specification, implementations of the Manager component are great places to incorporate user-friendly controls for interacting with other framework components, thereby acting as a central hub for user engagement with the overall architecture. For example, although not required by the specification, Managers may provide a web interface to add and manage roles and permissions for the Authorisation component or a way to manage files via the Files plugin component API.

## Overview

<CentralCluster hilite="manager"/>

- The Manager **MUST** offer a user interface enabling device configuration, including general information, connectivity, and schema mapping.
- The Manager **MUST** ensure compliance with the [Edge Agent Configuration Schema](https://github.com/AMRC-FactoryPlus/schemas/blob/main/Edge_Agent_Config.json) prior to considering a configuration valid and being served to an edge agent.
- The Manager **MUST** exclusively provide configurations to edge agents for devices that meet the selected [Device Schema](/docs/schemas) criteria, and never supply configurations with non-conforming devices.
- Confidential data **MUST** be removed from the configuration and substituted with a placeholder enclosed by `__` (e.g., `__key__`), with the sensitive data being accessible to the edge agent upon utilisation (e.g., through a Kubernetes Secret).
- The Manager **MUST** preserve valid configurations in a manner that allows authorised edge agents to retrieve them later.
- The Manager **MUST** create a principal for the node and grant it the `Edge Node` role.

## HTTP Interface

### Authentication

The Manager exposes a user interface via HTTP. All routes except the call to `/api/edge-agent-config` require an active session established by a previous call to the `/login` route. The session is established by providing a valid username and password. The session is terminated by a call to the `/logout` route. The call to `POST /api/edge-agent-config` does not require a session but does require a valid `node_id` and `config_password` to be present in the request body.
