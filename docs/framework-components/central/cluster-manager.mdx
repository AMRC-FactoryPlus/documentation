# Cluster Manager

The Cluster Manager commissions new clusters, and allows central
services to encrypt secret information for transfer to the edge
clusters.

## Overview

<CentralCluster hilite="cluster-manager"/>

## HTTP interface

The Git server supports the standard Git protocol over HTTP, in addition
to certain Factory+-specific endpoints. Authentication follows the
normal Factory+ conventions: Basic or Negotiate will be accepted, or a
Bearer token retrieved from the `/token` endpoint. Credentials are
checked against the Factory+ Identity service and authorised via the
Authorisation service.

Git repos are accessible by two different URLs. Access by UUID, normally
used by machines, uses the URL path `/uuid/{UUID}`. Access by path,
intended for human users and not used by the Factory+ components
internally, uses the path `/git/{path}`, where `{path}` is the `path`
property from the ConfigDB entry governing this repository. These two
URLs will access the same repo, with the same history.

## Well-Known UUIDs

These well-known UUIDs are part of the core framework and all **MUST**
to be registered with the Configuration Store component under the
appropriate classes.
