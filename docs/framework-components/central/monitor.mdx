# Central Monitor

The Monitor code runs on every cluster, both the central cluster and the
edge clusters. The instance on the central cluster operates a little
differently from the instances on the edge.

## Overview

<CentralCluster hilite="monitor"/>

The central Monitor relies on the Config Store to find the list of clusters
to monitor. The monitor monitors every cluster which has a _Cluster
status_ entry, indicating that the cluster has been successfully
bootstrapped and the Edge Sync operator on the cluster was operating
correctly at some point.

Having determined the list of clusters to monitor, the central monitor
then watches for the Sparkplug output of the edge monitor on each
cluster. The Node address of the edge monitor Node is currently
determined by a fixed rule: the cluster has a Sparkplug Group associated
with it, and the edge monitor must always use the `Monitor` Node address
within that group. If an edge monitor node goes offline or will not
respond to CMDs then the central monitor raises an alert.

## MQTT interface

The Monitor publishes as a Node. The Node metrics currently hold no
useful information beyond identifying the Node as a monitor node. For
each cluster monitored, a Device is created under the Node. This Device
publishes Link metrics linking to the edge monitor Node being monitored.
Cluster monitor devices publish DBIRTH and DDEATH when the list of
monitored clusters changes; the monitor device does not go offline when
the cluster becomes inaccessible.

If an edge monitor on a cluster has not published any packets in several
minutes a rebirth CMD will be sent. If the edge monitor does not respond
then the central monitor Device will raise an alert indicating that the
cluster is offline. The current set of alerts can be accessed via the
alerts API on the Directory.

## Well-Known UUIDs

These well-known UUIDs are part of the core framework and all **MUST**
to be registered with the Configuration Store component under the
appropriate classes.
