# Sealed Secrets

Sealed Secrets is an open-source Kubernetes operator designed to make it
possible to commit secret information to a Git repository without making
it generally accessible. To achieve this the secret information is
encrypted using a public key, the private half of which only exists on
the Kubernetes cluster which needs access to the information.

Sealed Secrets is not written or maintained by the AMRC Factory+ team.
